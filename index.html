=================================================================



![N|Solid](http://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/3/Jurassic-Park-Dinosaur-PNG-Free-Image.png)


     Existence: Velociraptor roamed the Earth about 85.8 million to 70.6 million years ago during the end of the Cretaceous Period.


**Growth** : Adult Velociraptors grew up to 6.8 feet (2 meters) long, 1.6 feet (0.5 meter) tall at the hip and weighed up to 33 lbs. (15 kilograms)

**Structure** :
Velociraptor had a relatively large skull , which was about 9.1 inches (23 centimeters) long, concave on the upper surface and convex on the lower surface

**Speed** They have been able to run up to roughly 40 mph (60 km/hr) for short bursts.

**Hunting Style** `This predator may have hunted in packs`


***There are other famous raports that weren't Velociraptor***


 * Balaur
 * Bambiraptor
 * Deinonychus
 * Dromaeosaurus



> The more that we learn about these animals the more we find that there is basically no difference between birds and their closely related dinosaur ancestors like velociraptor. Both have wishbones, brooded their nests, possess hollow bones, and were covered in feathers. If animals like velociraptor were alive today our first impression would be that they were just very unusual looking birds.
